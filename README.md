Medical Chatbot
This project is a medical chatbot that allows users to ask health-related questions and receive detailed answers by fetching relevant information from Wikipedia and generating responses using a pre-trained language model (Llama).

Project Overview
The Medical Chatbot fetches relevant summaries from Wikipedia based on a userâ€™s input, and uses a pre-trained Llama model to generate an informative response. The chatbot is designed to help users get quick information on various health topics by answering questions and explaining complex concepts in simple terms.

Main Steps:
User Input: The chatbot receives a health-related question from the user.
Wikipedia Fetching: The system uses the Wikipedia API to search for relevant articles and summaries based on the user's input.
Response Generation: The chatbot uses a pre-trained Llama language model to process the fetched article and generate a clear, conversational response.
Chat Interface: The interaction takes place in the console, where the user types a query and gets a response from the bot.
This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and language models to simulate a simple yet functional chatbot.
